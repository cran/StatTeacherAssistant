## Description

The `StatTeacherAssistant` `R` package includes an interactive Shiny
application, which is run locally on the userâ€™s machine. It enables
users to randomly generate data, make new versions of existing data
through common adjustments (e.g., adding random normal noise and
performing transformations), and check the suitability of the resulting
data for statistical analyses. The app was designed to support educators
in wide-ranging disciplines, with a particular focus on those teaching
introductory statistical methods (descriptive and/or inferential) for
data analysis.
